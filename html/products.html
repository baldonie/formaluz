            <h2>Eleo</h2>
            <p>
                Inspired by Italian Art Deco design, the Eleo pendant light features a bottom ceramic domed shade and an upholstered velvet top. This fixture is suspended from an oversized brass decorative chain that adds balance and elegance to the design. 
                
                This pendant light is perfect for adding a touch of retro style to any part of your home or office. It would look great in a living room, bedroom, or dining room. Installed at different heights, a cluster of these fixtures would make a bold statement for any entryway.

                  Nico Baldoni is an award-winning Los Angeles-based lighting designer. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to a lively Italian, Spanish, and Lebanese family. A natural visual artist with an affinity for painting and sketching, Nico's fascination for urban spaces and sculpture inspired him to study architecture at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. His interest in the impact of a lighting sculpture on its spatial environment led Nico to some of his early successes such as the Adidas flagship store in Buenos Aires.</p>

                    In 2005, Nico and his wife Eleonore Dailly, a filmmaker, moved to LA where he worked for some of the leading custom design companies before starting his own firm, Forma Luz in 2018. Since then Nico has been creating original and custom lighting for customers worldwide. He has designed projects for the Sofitel, Hilton, Ritz-Carlton, and Four Seasons hotels and some of the most prominent design firms in the US.
